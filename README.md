# TriviaGame
A web game that uses Javascript setInterval(), setTimeout() and clearInterval()

### Overview

In this assignment, I have created a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. I also applied a layout on this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS using animation.

### Game Design Notes 

* The game is called Flash Memory, a memory test game. Images will be displayed in a flash and the player needs to answer a question - in a flash - relating to the image.

* This mimics a trivia game that shows only one question at a time until the player answers it or their time runs out. These are timed questions that incorporates setInterval(), clearInterval() and setTimeout() in Javascript.

* As the page loads, an intro music will autoplay and instructions will be displayed. A start button is also present.

* Once the button is pressed, the left screen clears and images will appear on the right side for five seconds. The image is designed as if it had been taken by a polaroid with the polaroid shutter sound effect in place and is specifically positioned in front of the polaroid camera image which is used as background image for the game.

* After five seconds, the image disappears and a question will be displayed on the left side with multiple choices for an answer. A clock starts ticking for 10 seconds with a matching countdown sound effect and is visually displayed.

* If the player selects the correct answer, a screen will congratulate them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, the next question is automaticall displayed without user input.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

* If the player runs out of time, the player will be informed that time's up and display the correct answer.  The next question will automatically show.

* If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player will be informed they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. The same scenario as before, the next question/slide will automatically display.

* On the final screen, the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page) will be on display.

* I really wanted this game to set itself apart from an ordinary "trivia game" and thought that a memory test would be more fun and engaging. It was by accident that I was browsing at the collection of royalty-free photos online and a photo of a polaroid with a blue background really caught my eyes. I knew I wanted to use it as background image to go with the photo memory test game but was not sure yet which direction I was going with it. As the image grew on me, the concept of the game was slowly inspired by the popularity of game shows in the 60's through the 80's. In 'retrospect', I thought a retro theme would go well with my game and capture that era.  So I used retro background music and sound effects for game shows and text that is nostalgic of that time. Also by doing a "flash quiz", players might be compelled to retake the quiz to correct what they missed.
